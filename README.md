1. Define a class MyNumber having one private int data member. Write a default
constructor to initialize it to 0 and another constructor to initialize it to a value (Use this).
Write methods isNegative, isPositive, isZero, isOdd, isEven. Create an object in main.
Use command line arguments to pass a value to the object and perform the above tests.

2. Accept three integers using command line arguments and find their maximum and
minimum.

3. Define a Student class (roll number, name, percentage). Initialize data members with
parameterized constructor. Create N object of the student and display the object count after each
object is created. Also display the contents of each object toString() method. Apply descending sort on percentage & display all objects.

4. Define a class CricketPlayer (name, no_of_innings, no_times_notout, total_runs,
bat_avg). Create an array of n player objects. Calculate the batting average for each
player using a method avg(). Define a static method sortPlayer which sorts the
array on the basis of average. Display the player details in sorted order.

5. Create a class Date with day, month and year as members. Write appropriate member
functions/constructors.Create another class Student which has id, name ,date of birth and marks of
3 subjects as members. Write appropriate constructor for the student which assigns
values to the members. Accept the details as command line arguments and create a
student object using the arguments. Display the student details in a proper format.

6. Create a package named maths. Define class MathsOperations with static methods
to find the maximum and minimum of three numbers. Create another package stats.
Define class StatsOperations with methods to find the average and median of three
numbers. Use these methods in Test main to perform operations on three integers accepted
using command line arguments.

7. Write a Java program to create a Package SY which has a class SYMarks
(members  ComputerTotal, MathsTotal, and ElectronicsTotal). Create another package
TY which has a class TYMarks (members  Theory, Practicals). Create n objects of
Student class (having rollNumber, name, SYMarks and TYMarks). Add the marks of SY
and TY computer subjects and calculate the Grade (A for >= 70, B for >= 60 C for
>= 50 , Pass Class for > =40 else FAIL) and display the result of the student in proper format.

8. Define a class Employee having private members  id, name, department, salary.
Initialize with parameterized constructor. Create a subclass called Manager with
private member bonus. Create N objects of the Manager class and display the details of the manager having the maximum total salary (salary+bonus).

9. Define an interface IntOperations with methods to check whether an integer is
positive, negative, even, odd, prime and operations like factorial and sum of digits. Define
a class MyNumber having one private int data member. Write a default constructor to
initialize it to 0 and another constructor to initialize it to a value (Use this). Implement the
above interface. Create an object in main. Use command line arguments to pass a value to
the object and perform the above operations using a menu.
